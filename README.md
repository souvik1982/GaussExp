# A simple alternative to the Crystal Ball function

We present a simple alternative to the Crystal Ball function that has an exponential tail stitched to a Gaussian core. It has one parameter less than the Crystal Ball function and, where appropriate, offers more stable fits to peaks with exponential tails. The function may also be extended with two exponential tails on each side of the Gaussian, and this has two parameters less than the corresponding double-shouldered Crystal Ball function. This function may be of versatile use in experimental physics.
